1 cup 1/4" diced Roma/Plum Tomatoes

1/3 cup 1/4" diced Red Onion

1 -1/4" diced small Jalapeno (About 3" long seeds and stem removed)

1 clove garlic minced

1 tbl. spoon fresh cilantro leaves minced

Juice from one lime

Salt to taste

Mixed all ingredients in a bowl with a tight fitting lid. Refrigerate for a minimum of two hours so the flavors can blend. Keep refrigerated until ready to use. 

Note*  Pico de Gallo is best when served fresh therefore this recipe is intentionally designed to make a small amount but you can easily mutliply it if you have a large gathering or need more. I suggest using what you can and then discarding any unused portion after 3-4 days.
