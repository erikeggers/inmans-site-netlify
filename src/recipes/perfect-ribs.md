**Ingredients:**

1. Fresh rack St Louis Style Ribs
2. Inman’s Smokehouse Dry Rub
3. Your Favorite Inman’s BBQ Sauce

**Directions:**

1. Wash ribs and pat dry with a paper towel.
2. Remove membrane from underside of ribs. If you are not familiar with this procedure I suggest you research how it is done on the internet. There are several videos available that will show you how it is done.
3. Liberally coat ribs on both sides with Inman’s Smokehouse Dry Rub.
4. Smoke ribs at 250 degrees for 4-5 hours. Remove from the smoker when internal temperature reached 185-190 degrees and ribs droop when picked up in the center using tongs.
5. Remove ribs from smoker. Wrap with aluminum foil and place in well insulated cooler for one hour.
6. Enjoy the ribs with your favorite Inman’s BBQ Sauce.
7. (Optional) If you prefer your ribs basted with sauce you can place them on a preheated grill.

Medium temperature. Baste the ribs with your Favorite sauce for 5 minutes making sure not to burn sauce.

Refrigerate any leftovers.
