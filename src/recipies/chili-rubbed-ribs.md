## Ingredients

3 tablespoons packed brown sugar

2 tablespoons paprika

2 tablespoons chili powder

3 teaspoons ground cumin

2 teaspoons garlic powder

1 teaspoon salt

6 pounds pork baby back ribs

## GLAZE:

1 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce

1 cup packed brown sugar

2/3 cup ketchup

1/3 cup lemon juice

1-1/2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger root

## DIRECTIONS

Mix the first six ingredients; rub over ribs. Refrigerate, covered, 30 minutes.

Wrap rib racks in large pieces of heavy-duty foil; seal tightly. Grill, covered, over indirect medium heat 1 to 1-1/2 hours or until tender.

In a large saucepan, combine glaze ingredients; cook, uncovered, over medium heat 6-8 minutes or until heated through and sugar is dissolved, stirring occasionally.

Carefully remove ribs from foil. Place ribs over direct heat; brush with some of the glaze. Grill, covered, over medium heat 25-30 minutes or until browned, turning and brushing ribs occasionally with remaining glaze.
